              <strong>Professional Discussion</strong>: Choosing either a listserv (e.g., ATTW-L,
              CPTSC) to follow or following academics in technical communication and related fields
              on Twitter; posting and participation is encouraged, but not required.

              <strong>Background Article</strong>: Choosing one key article cited by an assigned
              reading in <cite>Central Works in Technical Communication</cite> and preparing a
              digital handout for the class that includes the citation, the connection to
              <cite>Central Works</cite>, plus an outline, key quote, and summary of the article and
              delivering a max. 10-minute presentation on it to the class. See <a
              href="stolley-example.htm">Stolleyâ€™s example</a>. (Note: Your background article must
              not itself appear in <cite>Central Works</cite>.) (10pts)

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Conference Proposal</strong>: An individual paper proposal (or panel proposal,
              if multiple students wish to collaborate), following the specific call for papers
              (CFP) of an actual technical communication or related conference: ATTW, IEEE/IPCC,
              CPTSC, etc. Alternatively, students may write an article proposal in response to a CFP
              for a special issue of a journal or an edited book collection. (draft due 9/12, final
              due 9/19; 10pts)

              <strong>Annotated Bibliography</strong>: Covers the past 5-7 years of a specific topic
              in technical communication or related fields, one that should be leading towards a
              possible dissertation topic or MS project; 20 key sources (articles, chapters, and
              books) with paragraph-long annotations. (draft due 10/3, final due 10/24; 25pts)

              <strong>Article-Length Literature Review/Bibliographic Essay</strong>: Approaching
              publishable length &amp; quality and based on the Annotated Bibliography; drafted with
              a specific technical communication journal in mind and according to that journal's
              submission guidelines and citation/formatting style. Should frame a particular
              argument for placing and understanding the last 5-7 years of research, and likely
              suggests or forecasts future research directions in the topic area. (draft due 11/21,
              final due 12/5; 25pts)

            <h4>Requirements</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Length</b>: 5000-6000 words (about 20-25 double-spaced pages)</li>
              <li>
                <b>Manuscript and Citation Format</b>: Follow the guidelines for a specific journal
                that you think would publish your essay.

            <p>
              The challenge to writing a good bibliographic essay or literature review is to avoid
              a big dumping of notes. A successful bibliographic essay will feature:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                An argument as to how to understand or frame the work/theme/topic area that the bibliographic essay covers.
              </li>
              <li>
                An appropriate organizational scheme to cover the work: chronology is rarely the best choice, unless your argument has to do with something that unfolds over time (e.g., how technical communication scholarship changed in the years after 9/11/2001). Arranging your essay around particular themes, the work of particular people (if there are only a few major figures), or particular sub-topics in the area are all plausible; however, your research topic will be the best thing to consider as you develop some form of organization. Think in terms of headings and outlines, if that will help you.
              </li>
              <li>
                Judicious quotation from the sources that you cite. Summarize when possible, quote when necessary is one way to think about when to quote and when not.
              </li>
              <li>
                Suggestions and directions for future research based on the argument that your bibliographic essay lays out (hint: thinking about suggestions/directions early on may very well help you to invent the argument that you advance in your essay).
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

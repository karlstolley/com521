<h3>Article Outline</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Introduction: “What is technical writing...and how does it differ from any other” type of writing?</li>
  <li>Reviews four categories of definitions of technical writing (pp. 113-114)
    <ol>
      <li>Def. by its subject matter</li>
      <li>Def. by its linguistic features</li>
      <li>Def. by its underlying thought processes</li>
      <li>Def. by its purpose, esp. “imaginitive” vs. “functional literature” (R. Kapp)</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Extends Kapp by claiming tech writing is primarily def. by an author trying “to convey one meaning only one meaning in what he says” (pp. 114)</li>
  <li>Suggests division of “scientific and aesthetic communication” and analogy of a bugle call vs. a symphony</li>
  <li>Heads off the counter-argument against the divisions being too broad by suggesting that any sense of “too broad” being a product of tech writing definitions that focus on subject matter</li>
  <li>Technical subject matter is, however, not the issue; moves from the “nature” of tech writing to the “training” and education it suggests</li>
  <li>Concludes that not just English teachers but “all of us in education” share responsibility for failing to meet the needs of technical writing</li>

<h2>A Key Quote</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    “In fact, I believe that in all too many instances, at least in college, the student writes the wrong thing, for the wrong reason, to the wrong person, who evaluates it on the wrong basis. That is, he writes about a subject he is not throughly informed upon, in ordered to exhibit his knowledge, rather than explain something the reader does not understand, and he writes to a professor who already knows more than he does about the matter and who evaluates the paper, not in terms of what he has derived, but in terms of what he thinks the writer knows. <em>In every respect, this is the converse of what happens in professional life, where the writer is the authority</em>...” (p. 116, emphasis added)

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
  W. Earl Britton argues for a more direct and purposeful definition of technical writing that “illuminates the tasks of both the teachers and authors of technical writing” (p. 113). His audience is clearly teachers of technical writing, with a secondary audience of writing teachers generally (given that his article appears in <em>CCC</em>). By examining four different categories of definition--by subject matter, linguistic features, thought process, and purpose--and citing salient examples of each definition type, Britton offers new insight to the field by extending the definitions he reviews, particularly with regard to the purpose of technical writing. He arrives at the conclusion that a defining characteristic of technical and scientific writing “lies in the effort of the author to convey one meaning and only one meaning” (p. 114), as opposed to literary forms of writing that deliberately invite multiple interpretations. Britton establishes his definition through the analogy of a bugle call (functional communication) and a symphony (aesthetic communication), but notes that, even something like a bugle call can be treated stylistically and with aesthetic meaning, as when taps is played with such beauty as to evoke tears (p. 115). Meaning that, even though technical writing’s purpose is to convey a single, unambiguous meaning, the role of style and other traditional aspects of the craft of writing still matter.

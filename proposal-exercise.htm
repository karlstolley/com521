<h2>Conference Proposal Exercise</h2>

<p>
  Below are two conference proposals (both written by your instructor). As a class, we’ll look at the CFPs and act as proposal reviewers to determine whether either of these proposals should be accepted to the conference for which it was submitted.
</p>

<h3>ATTW 2008 (<a href="attw-2008-cfp.txt">Original CFP</a>)</h3>

<blockquote>
  <h4>Proposal Title: Rethinking Digital Literacy in Terms of “Open Source.”</h4>
  <p>
    This speaker will argue for students and practitioners of technical writing to adopt an open-source-literate attitude towards digital production, so as to begin building digital literacy at the (open) source level.
  </p>
  <p>
    Open source software technologies, both online (e.g., Drupal) and desktop (e.g., OpenOffice), have been garnering an increasing amount of attention and classroom implementation within the field of technical writing. However, “open source” has become too often conflated with “free software.” 
  </p>
  <p>
    Trends in technical writing and related fields toward open source software suggest primarily, if not exclusively, an economic sea change for digital production--not a literate one. While the digital *access* divide represented by Adobe or Microsoft’s escalating price tags may be ameliorated by free downloads of comparable software, a digital *literacy* divide still remains, both in- and outside technical writing programs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Indeed, much of current “digital literacy” could be better described as “software proficiency.” While software proficiency has served to build interest in and theory of digital production, it has also assigned maximum supremacy to the mouse click. The era of open source, however, calls for our renewed attention to the keystroke, particularly in terms of the source code that makes digital production possible.

<h3>Feminisms and Rhetorics 2009 (<a href="femrhet-2009-cfp.txt">Original CFP</a>)</h3>

<blockquote>
<h4>Proposal Title: Engaging the General Public in Web Design Literacy and Continuity of Access Through Portable Apps</h4>
  <p>
    In this presentation, I describe the challenges of building a web writing and design workshop for the general public that is offered through the Chicago Public Libraries (CPL). In particular, I consider the overwhelming problems of access, commonly described as the “digital divide,” which can be addressed through the use of free and open source software (FOSS) to write and design web pages. Of particular interest to people concerned with community digital literacies is FOSS that can be installed and run on a USB drive, known as “portable apps.” Portable apps provide continuity of access for workshop participants who are what I call “digital drifters”: people with no computers of their own, who face access issues that are different from simply having no access at all. Digital drifters find themselves at the mercy of whatever software is installed on a particular computer. Portable apps are central to establishing continuity of access similar to that of people who own computers.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, portable apps require individuals to develop a more intensive, often code-level digital literacy than is commonly encountered through proprietary web design software, such as Adobe Dreamweaver. I argue that building an intensive, code-level digital literacy is a central goal of web design workshops for the general public. Despite its outward appearances, this intensive digital literacy should not be interpreted as a remedial trade-off to address access problems. Instead, I argue that this literacy serves the interests of workshop participants, empowering them to authoritatively write and design for the web.

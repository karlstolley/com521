        <h3>Course Description</h3>
        <p>
          This course is an introduction to some of the foundational and current intellectual work
          and scholarship in technical communication and related fields. As a course primarily
          intended for students in IIT’s PhD program in Technical Communication, it is also an
          introduction to becoming a contributing member of the field: learning to read scholarship
          carefully and closely, conducting library research, staying current with the field’s
          developments, and writing in a number of academic genres essential to any type of research
          and research agenda, including annotated bibliographies, literature reviews, and
          conference and/or article proposals.

        <h3>Attendance and Participation</h3>
        <p>
          Your attendance and active participation are required both for your own success in the
          class, and for the success of the class as a whole. However, if you absolutely must miss,
          please <a href="#contact">contact me</a> ahead of time via email.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Academic Honesty</h3>
        <p>
          As with any course at IIT, you are expected to uphold the Code of Academic Honesty (p. 48
          of the <a href="http://www.iit.edu/graduate_college/bulletin/pdfs/bulletin10-12.pdf">IIT
          Graduate Bulletin 2010-2012</a>). All work for this course should be your own original
          effort, including print and digital page design and computer code. Summarizations and
          quotations of text, as well as any use of open-source code libraries and images not of
          your own making, should be clearly cited as legally and ethically warranted and
          rhetorically appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are at all uncertain as to whether you are submitting work that in whole or in part
          may violate the Code of Academic Honesty, please contact me immediately and before the
          work is due. The consequences of academic dishonesty are severe. Any student who violates
          the Code of Academic Honesty will be subject to expulsion from this course with a failing
          grade, and I will report the student to the Chair of the Department of Humanities and the
          Associate Dean of Graduate Academic Affairs, who may take additional disciplinary action.
        </p>

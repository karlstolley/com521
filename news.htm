      <h3>Proposal-Writing Tips</h3>
      <p class="summary"><b>8/29/2011</b>: How about a crash-course in proposal writing? Here are some tips.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Get to the point, and fast.</b> The first sentence should be your proposal in a
          nutshell; no citations, no jargon, no whimsical stories. Just a straight-up
          description of your proposed talk, panel, workshop, or article.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Use citations only to plug into a broader discussion.</b> The rhetorical goal of a
          proposal is to get accepted to the conference, special issue, collection, etc. It is not
          to prove the validity of your argument. Bog yourself down in too many citations, and your
          unique contribution may very well be lost. Of course, if you are responding or building
          off of a particular work, you’ll want to cite it; just as you may want to cite an item or
          two that demonstrates you’re aware of broader discussions surrounding your topic.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Keep jargon and specialist terminology to an absolute minimum.</b> This is particularly
          true for conference proposals, which are reviewed by a broader and often less-specialized
          range people than journal articles/article proposals. Plus, conference planners like to
          host panels that are specific enough to be identifiable with a particular research area,
          but open and accessible enough to be of potential interest to a broad range of their
          typical conference attendees.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Stay well within the stated maximum word or page count of proposals.</b> No proposal
          reviewer wants to read anything longer than was asked for. And if you find yourself
          struggling to stay within the limits of anything 500 words or longer, consider a serious
          rewrite.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Avoid long-winded, inductive sentences and paragraphs.</b> Be direct, brief, and write
          SVO sentences like you were back in high school English class.
        </li>
        <li>
          Don’t make any tortured rhetorical moves to tie your proposal to conference themes. Most
          conferences have a theme, and if your topic fits with the theme, by all means play up that
          point. But if your topic doesn’t, don’t try and stretch it. A good conference proposal
          will generally be accepted regardless of whether it ties to the theme. This tip, however,
          does not apply to special journal issue themes, which your article proposal should
          specifically address.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Avoid including any information in the body of the proposal that identifies you or your
          institution in any way.</b> Watch yourself on this one; it’s a personal pet peeve of mine
          when I review, but I know that other reviewers look down upon it, too. Simple, unassuming
          things like proposal-related URLs, screen shots, and names of actual projects or courses
          should be avoided at all costs.
        </li>
